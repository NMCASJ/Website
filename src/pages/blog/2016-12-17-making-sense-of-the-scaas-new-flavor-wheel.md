Counselors for Social Justice (CSJ) acknowledges the systemic barriers within our society and profession that impact clients, students, counselors, schools, families, and communities. We use personal and collective activism as a vehicle to address disparities through collaboration with communities, schools, mental health practitioners, and other service providers, as well as involvement in political, regulatory, and legislative processes. Our mission is to incorporate social justice advocacy into our roles as clinicians, supervisors, educators, and researchers by:

1. building relationships within the schools and communities in which we work;
2. addressing institutional and educational barriers at all levels;
3. uplifting marginalized and minoritized voices; and
4. producing anti-racist and anti-oppressive research and theory that address inequities and promote social change.
